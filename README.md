# Responsive-Landing-Page

Responsive redesign of my landing page project from The Odin Project

## Overview

This project is a mobile-first redesign of my original static landing page.
The goal is to make it responsive across different screen sizes using HTML and CSS (flexbox and media queries).

## Features

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Semantic HTML structure
- Flexbox based layouts for easy alignment and spacing
- Consistent color palette and typography

## What I Learned

- Building layouts that adapt across screen sizes
- Applying flexbox for both column and row layouts
- Why setting a base font size and global box-sizing helps responsiveness
- Using media queries to adapt layouts across screen sizes
- Using relative units such as rem and percent to manage scaling and spacing
- Writing clear and organized git commit messages for each section

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)
- Google Fonts (Roboto)
