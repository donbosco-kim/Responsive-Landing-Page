# Responsive-Landing-Page

Responsive redesign of my landing page project from The Odin Project

## Overview

This project is a mobile-first redesign of my original static landing page.
The goal is to make it responsive across different screen sizes using HTML and CSS (flexbox and media queries).

## Current Progress

- Completed mobile-first design
- Implemented flexbox layouts for all sections
- Used relative units such as rem and percentage for flexible sizing

## What I Learned

- How to build layouts using a mobile-first approach
- How to use flexbox for vertical stacking
- Why setting a base font size and global box-sizing helps responsiveness
